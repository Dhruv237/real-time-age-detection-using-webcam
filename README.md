# real-time-age-detection-using-webcam or nvidia csi-camera
This project generally doest therealtime detection of age of a person using system webcamera or nvidia camera  and predicts the age range with some percentag.
for example for the face of person of age 19 years it will predict 97.37% of range  15-20 years with the use of jetson nano kit.
with the this webcam application we can see the predicted age results on live tracking of our face with different age predictions.
This project includes primary functionalities:-
1)detecting face on webcam
2)capturing and processing of image of the face captured
3)predicting the age  that face image taken from live camera.
Note:-
for running we have to download the file"res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel" from  "https://github.com/gopinath-balu/computer_vision/tree/master/CAFFE_DNN" online source as this the size of big file which was not being able to upload in this link so am sorry for that inconvinience
